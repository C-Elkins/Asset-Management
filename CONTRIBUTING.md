## üìù Code Standards

### Backend (Java)

- Follow **Google Java Style Guide**
- Use meaningful variable and method names
- Write Javadoc for public APIs
- Minimum 80% test coverage
- Use Spring Boot conventions and best practices
- Handle errors gracefully with proper exception handling

Example:
```java
/**
 * Retrieves an asset by its unique identifier.
 *
 * @param id the asset ID
 * @return the asset entity
 * @throws AssetNotFoundException if asset doesn't exist
 */
@GetMapping("/{id}")
public ResponseEntity<Asset> getAsset(@PathVariable Long id) {
    return ResponseEntity.ok(assetService.findById(id));
}
```

### Frontend (JavaScript/React)

- Follow **Airbnb JavaScript Style Guide**
- Use functional components with hooks
- Implement proper error boundaries
- Write unit tests for components
- Follow accessibility (a11y) best practices
- Use TypeScript when possible

Example:
```javascript
/**
 * Asset card component for displaying asset summary
 */
const AssetCard = ({ asset, onEdit, onDelete }) => {
  const handleEdit = useCallback(() => {
    onEdit(asset.id);
  }, [asset.id, onEdit]);

  return (
    <Card>
      <CardHeader>{asset.name}</CardHeader>
      <CardBody>{asset.description}</CardBody>
    </Card>
  );
