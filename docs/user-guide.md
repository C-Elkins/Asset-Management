  permissions.

## Data Import

You can import categories and assets from JSON files.

- Categories: POST /imports/categories accepts a body like:
  {
    "categories": [
      { name, description?, colorCode?, icon?, active?, sortOrder? }
    ]
  }
- Assets: POST /imports/assets accepts a body like:
  {
    "assets": [
      { name, assetTag, categoryId? or categoryName?, ...other fields }
    ]
  }

From the UI, go to Assets and click "Import JSON".
Use the templates as a starting point:

- frontend/public/examples/categories-template.json
- frontend/public/examples/assets-template.json

Notes:

- Assets require either categoryId or categoryName.
- On duplicate names/tags, records are updated idempotently.
