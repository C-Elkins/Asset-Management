## üèõÔ∏è Why Delaware Law is Standard for SaaS

## ü§î Common Concerns Addressed

### "But I'm in Florida, isn't that confusing?"

**No!** Your governing law ‚â† your physical location.

- **Where you live:** Florida
- **Where your business is incorporated:** (Likely Delaware or Florida)
- **What law governs disputes:** Delaware (your choice)

**This is perfectly legal and standard practice.**

### "Will I get sued in Delaware?"

**Not necessarily.** The governing law clause specifies **which state's laws apply**, not always where lawsuits are filed.

Most Terms of Service include TWO clauses:
1. **Governing Law:** Delaware law applies (substantive rules)
2. **Jurisdiction/Venue:** Where lawsuits can be filed (location)

**Your Terms of Service (Section 15) includes:**
```
"You agree to submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts located 
in New Castle County, Delaware, to resolve any legal matter arising from these Terms."
```

This means:
- ‚úÖ Delaware law governs the interpretation
- ‚úÖ Lawsuits should be filed in Delaware courts
- ‚úÖ This protects you from being sued in many different states

**Alternative (if you prefer):** You can specify Florida courts while keeping Delaware governing law:
```
"Governed by Delaware law, but any lawsuits must be filed in Miami-Dade County, Florida."
```

### "Do I need to incorporate in Delaware?"

**Not required, but common.**

- **Governing law in ToS** ‚â† **State of incorporation**
- You CAN choose Delaware law even if incorporated in Florida
- Many SaaS companies incorporate in Delaware for the same reasons

**Current recommendation:** If you plan to raise funding or sell the company someday, incorporate in Delaware.

### "What about my users in other states?"

**Addressed in your Terms of Service Section 14:**
```
"Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion of certain warranties or 
the limitation of liability... In such jurisdictions, our liability will 
be limited to the maximum extent permitted by law."
```

This means:
- ‚úÖ Delaware law is the default
- ‚úÖ BUT state consumer protection laws still apply where required
- ‚úÖ Users in California still get California consumer protections
- ‚úÖ This is standard and expected

## üó∫Ô∏è Should You Change to Florida Law?

### Keep Delaware If:
- ‚úÖ You plan to raise venture capital
- ‚úÖ You plan to sell the company eventually
- ‚úÖ You want predictable, well-tested legal framework
- ‚úÖ You operate in multiple states (Florida law isn't better)
- ‚úÖ Your competitors use Delaware (standard practice)

### Change to Florida If:
- ‚ö†Ô∏è You only serve Florida customers (rare for SaaS)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è You have strong personal preference
- ‚ö†Ô∏è You already have Florida legal counsel on retainer

**Most SaaS attorneys will recommend keeping Delaware.**

## üõ†Ô∏è If You Want to Change to Florida Law

I can update your legal documents to use Florida law instead. Here's what would change:

### Terms of Service (Section 15):
```markdown
**Current:**
These Terms shall be governed by the laws of the State of Delaware...

**Changed to:**
These Terms shall be governed by the laws of the State of Florida...
```

### Privacy Policy (Section 15):
```markdown
**Current:**
This Privacy Policy shall be governed by the laws of Delaware...

**Changed to:**
This Privacy Policy shall be governed by the laws of Florida...
```

**Should we make this change?** (I recommend keeping Delaware, but it's your call)

## ‚ùì Still Have Questions?

Common follow-ups:

**Q: Do I need to pay Delaware franchise tax?**  
A: Only if you're incorporated in Delaware. Choosing Delaware law in your ToS doesn't require incorporation there.

**Q: Can I be sued in Florida anyway?**  
A: Possibly, but your Terms of Service try to prevent this with the exclusive jurisdiction clause. Delaware law would still apply.

**Q: What if a customer doesn't read my Terms of Service?**  
A: The law assumes users agree to ToS when they create an account (standard "clickwrap" agreement). Your ToS are legally binding.

**Q: Does this affect GDPR compliance?**  
A: No. GDPR is EU law and applies regardless of your chosen governing law. Your Privacy Policy already addresses this.

**Q: Is this what Stripe uses?**  
A: Yes! Stripe's Terms of Service use Delaware law (and they're based in California).

**TL;DR:** Delaware law is standard for SaaS, regardless of where you live. It's like using AWS (in Virginia) even though your office is in Florida. Keep it unless you have a specific reason to change. üöÄ
