# 🎯 Ready When You Are

## ✅ What I Did

1. **Stopped All Servers**
   - Backend (Spring Boot) - STOPPED ✅
   - Frontend (Vite) - STOPPED ✅
   - All processes terminated cleanly

2. **Analyzed Your Pricing Structure**
   - Free: $0 (50 assets, 3 users)
   - Professional: $49/mo or $490/yr (500 assets, 25 users)
   - Enterprise: $199/mo or $1,990/yr (unlimited)
   - Metered: $0.50 per asset overage

3. **Created Complete Setup Guides**
   - 📘 `STRIPE_SETUP_CHECKLIST.md` - Full step-by-step Stripe configuration
   - 📗 `QUICK_START.md` - Fast restart commands
   - 📕 `PRICING_BREAKDOWN.md` - Detailed pricing analysis
   - 📙 `RESTART_SUMMARY.md` - System status and configuration

## 🚀 When You're Ready to Start

### 1. Start Backend

```bash
cd it-asset-management/backend
./mvnw spring-boot:run
```

### 2. Start Frontend

```bash
cd it-asset-management/frontend
npm run dev
```

### 3. Fix "Backend Offline" Issue

If login page still shows backend offline:

**Most Common Issue: CORS 403 Error**

✅ **FIXED!** I've updated the CORS configuration to allow `http://localhost:3005`

**You MUST restart the backend for this fix to work:**
```bash
# Stop backend (Ctrl+C in backend terminal, or:)
pkill -f "spring-boot:run"

# Start backend again
cd backend && ./mvnw spring-boot:run
```

**Other Debugging Steps:**
- Make sure backend is running on port 8080: `lsof -i :8080`
- Check browser console (F12) for actual error
- Look for CORS errors (403 Forbidden)
- Verify backend logs: `tail -f backend/backend.log`

## 💳 Stripe Pricing Setup Tasks

### Quick Steps

1. **Go to Stripe**: <https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/products>

2. **Create 2 Products**:
   - Professional Plan (2 prices: $49/mo, $490/yr)
   - Enterprise Plan (2 prices: $199/mo, $1,990/yr)

3. **Create Metered Billing**:
   - Additional Assets ($0.50 per asset)

4. **Copy 5 Price IDs** from Stripe Dashboard

5. **Update Config Files**:
   - `backend/src/main/resources/application-dev.yml`
   - `frontend/.env.development`

6. **Restart Both Servers**

7. **Test**: Card 4242 4242 4242 4242

## 🐛 Known Issues to Fix

### Issue: "Backend is offline" on login page ✅ SOLVED!

**Root Cause**: CORS configuration was missing `http://localhost:3005`

**Solution Applied**: 
I've added the correct CORS configuration in `application-dev.yml`:
```yaml
app:
  cors:
    allowed-origins: "http://localhost:3000,http://localhost:3005,http://localhost:5173"
```

**Action Required**: 
**Restart the backend** to apply the fix:
```bash
pkill -f "spring-boot:run"
cd backend && ./mvnw spring-boot:run
```

**Other Possible Causes** (if restart doesn't fix it):

1. Backend not running → Check: `lsof -i :8080`
2. Wrong port (should be 8080)
3. Frontend pointing to wrong API URL
4. Browser cache → Try hard refresh (Cmd+Shift+R)

**Debug Steps**:

```bash
# Check if backend is running
lsof -i :8080

# Check backend logs
tail -f backend/backend.log

# Check what frontend is trying to connect to
# Look in browser console (F12) for network errors
```
