## Overview

Krubles now supports **Slack notifications** for real-time asset management updates! This feature allows administrators to receive automated notifications in their Slack channels when important asset events occur.

### What Gets Notified?

- 🆕 **Asset Created** - When new assets are added to the system
- ✏️ **Asset Updated** - When asset details are modified
- 👤 **Asset Assigned** - When assets are assigned to users
- 🔧 **Maintenance Scheduled** - When maintenance is scheduled
- ✅ **Maintenance Completed** - When maintenance work is finished
- ⚠️ **Warranties Expiring** - Daily digest of assets with expiring warranties (within 30 days)
- 🔧 **Maintenance Due** - Daily digest of assets needing maintenance (within 7 days)

## Setup Instructions

### Step 1: Create a Slack Incoming Webhook

1. Go to your Slack workspace
2. Navigate to **Apps** → **Incoming Webhooks**
3. Click **"Add to Slack"**
4. Choose the channel where you want notifications (e.g., `#asset-alerts`)
5. Click **"Add Incoming WebHooks integration"**
6. Copy the **Webhook URL** (looks like: `https://hooks.slack.com/services/T00000000/B00000000/XXXXXXXXXXXX`)

### Step 2: Configure Krubles Backend

Set the following environment variables:

```bash
# Required: Your Slack webhook URL
export SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL="https://hooks.slack.com/services/YOUR/WEBHOOK/URL"

# Required: Enable Slack notifications
export SLACK_NOTIFICATIONS_ENABLED=true
```

#### Docker/Docker Compose

Add to your `docker-compose.yml`:

```yaml
services:
  backend:
    environment:
      - SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL=https://hooks.slack.com/services/YOUR/WEBHOOK/URL
      - SLACK_NOTIFICATIONS_ENABLED=true
```

#### Local Development

Add to your shell profile (`.bashrc`, `.zshrc`, etc.):

```bash
export SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL="https://hooks.slack.com/services/YOUR/WEBHOOK/URL"
export SLACK_NOTIFICATIONS_ENABLED=true
```

Then restart your backend server.

### Step 3: Test the Connection

1. Log into Krubles as an **IT_ADMIN** or **SUPER_ADMIN**
2. Navigate to **Settings** → **Integrations** → **Slack**
3. Click **"Test Connection"**
4. Check your Slack channel for a test message

## How Notifications Work

### Automatic Triggers

Slack notifications are **automatically sent** when:
- Admins create, update, or assign assets in the dashboard
- Maintenance is scheduled or completed
- System runs daily checks for expiring warranties and maintenance due

### Async Processing

All notifications are sent **asynchronously** to avoid slowing down the main application. If Slack is temporarily unavailable, the notification will fail gracefully without affecting your asset management operations.

### Message Formatting

- Uses **Slack Markdown** for rich formatting
- Emojis for quick visual scanning
- Structured data for clarity
- Configurable per notification type

---

## Troubleshooting

### Notifications Not Appearing?

1. **Check Configuration**:
   ```bash
   # Verify environment variables are set
   echo $SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL
   echo $SLACK_NOTIFICATIONS_ENABLED
   ```

2. **Test Connection**: Use the `/slack/test` endpoint

3. **Check Backend Logs**:
   ```bash
   # Look for Slack-related errors
   tail -f backend/logs/application.json | grep -i slack
   ```

4. **Verify Webhook URL**: Make sure it starts with `https://hooks.slack.com/`

5. **Check Slack Permissions**: Ensure the webhook has permission to post to the channel

### Messages Not Formatted Correctly?

- Slack webhooks require specific JSON format
- The system uses Markdown formatting (`*bold*`, `_italic_`)
- If formatting breaks, check Slack's API documentation

---

## Security Considerations

### Webhook URL Security

- ⚠️ **Never commit webhook URLs to Git**
- ✅ Always use environment variables
- ✅ Rotate webhook URLs if exposed
- ✅ Restrict webhook permissions to specific channels

### Access Control

- Only **IT_ADMIN** and **SUPER_ADMIN** roles can configure Slack
- Notification content respects existing RBAC rules
- Sensitive data (purchase prices, vendor info) is not included in notifications

---

## Advanced Configuration

### Custom Notification Filtering

Want to filter which events send Slack notifications? Modify `SlackService.java`:

```java
@Async
public void sendAssetCreatedNotification(Asset asset) {
    if (!isConfigured()) {
        return;
    }
    
    // Only notify for high-value assets
    if (asset.getPurchasePrice() != null && 
        asset.getPurchasePrice().compareTo(new BigDecimal("5000")) > 0) {
        // Send notification...
    }
}
```

### Multiple Channels

To send different notifications to different channels, create multiple webhook URLs and modify the service:

```java
@Value("${slack.webhook.critical-alerts:}")
private String criticalAlertsUrl;

@Value("${slack.webhook.general-updates:}")
private String generalUpdatesUrl;
```

## Future Enhancements

- 🎯 **Custom Notification Rules** - User-defined triggers
- 👥 **User Mentions** - Tag specific users in notifications
- 📎 **Attachment Support** - Include images, charts, reports
- 🔗 **Deep Links** - Direct links to assets in Krubles dashboard
- ⚙️ **Dashboard UI** - Configure Slack settings via web interface (currently API-only)

## FAQ

**Q: Can I use Microsoft Teams instead of Slack?**  
A: Not yet, but Teams integration is on our roadmap! The webhook architecture is already in place.

**Q: Will this slow down my application?**  
A: No! Notifications are sent asynchronously and won't block asset operations.

**Q: Can I turn off specific notification types?**  
A: Currently all-or-nothing via `SLACK_NOTIFICATIONS_ENABLED`. Custom filtering coming soon!

**Q: What if Slack is down?**  
A: Notifications will fail gracefully. Your asset management operations continue unaffected.

**Q: Is this visible on marketing pages?**  
A: **No!** This is a backend feature accessed only through the authenticated admin dashboard.
