## ✨ Smart Asset Creation

### Real-Time AI Analysis
When creating a new asset, the AI automatically analyzes what you're entering and provides intelligent suggestions:

**How it works:**
1. Start typing an asset name (e.g., "MacBook Pro 16-inch")
2. AI analyzes the input within 800ms
3. Receives smart suggestions with confidence scores

**What AI detects:**
- **Brand Recognition**: Detects 15+ brands across industries
  - Technology: Apple, Dell, HP, Lenovo, Microsoft, Cisco
  - Automotive: Toyota, Ford, Honda, Chevrolet  
  - Medical: Philips, GE Healthcare, Siemens
  - Manufacturing: Caterpillar, John Deere, Bosch, DeWalt

- **Category Detection**: Auto-suggests category with confidence %
  - Computers (laptops, desktops, PCs)
  - Vehicles (cars, trucks, vans)
  - Medical Devices (monitors, pumps, ventilators)
  - Tools & Equipment
  - And more...

- **Smart Descriptions**: Auto-generates descriptions based on detected info

**Example Flow:**
```
User types: "MacBook Pro 16-inch"
↓
AI analyzes (800ms debounce)
↓
Shows banner: "AI detected: Computers (95% confidence)"
                "Brand: Apple"
↓
Auto-fills:
  - Category: "Computers"
  - Brand: "Apple"
  - Description: "Professional laptop from Apple"
```

## 🎯 AI Service Architecture

### Client-Side Intelligence (`aiService.js`)

**Core Methods:**

1. **`analyzeAsset(assetData)`**
   - Main analysis endpoint
   - Sends to backend `/api/v1/ai/analyze-asset`
   - Falls back to client-side patterns if API unavailable
   - Returns: category, brand, confidence, suggestions

2. **`getFieldSuggestions(field, value, context)`**
   - Auto-complete as you type
   - Context-aware suggestions
   - Examples:
     - Vendor suggestions based on category
     - Location suggestions based on asset type
     - Model suggestions based on brand

3. **`predictMaintenance(assetId)`**
   - Forecasts maintenance needs
   - Based on:
     - Asset age
     - Historical maintenance patterns
     - Category-specific schedules
     - Condition deterioration rates
   - Returns: next maintenance date, estimated cost, urgency

4. **`generateInsights(filters)`**
   - Data-driven recommendations
   - Analyzes current inventory
   - Considers:
     - Status distribution
     - Category trends
     - Budget utilization
     - Maintenance schedules
   - Returns array of insights with priority levels

5. **`detectTrends(timeRange)`**
   - Pattern recognition in asset data
   - Time ranges: 7, 30, 90, 365 days
   - Detects:
     - Growth patterns
     - Category shifts
     - Cost trends
     - Maintenance frequency changes

6. **`smartSearch(query)`**
   - Natural language queries
   - Examples:
     - "Show me all cars needing maintenance"
     - "Find laptops purchased last year"
     - "List expensive equipment over $10,000"
   - Parses query and returns structured filters

### Fallback Intelligence

**When API is unavailable, AI still works!**

Brand Detection Patterns (15+ brands):
```javascript
// Technology
apple: ['apple', 'macbook', 'iphone', 'ipad', 'imac'] → Computers (95% confidence)
dell: ['dell', 'latitude', 'precision', 'xps'] → Computers (95% confidence)
hp: ['hp', 'elitebook', 'pavilion', 'omen'] → Computers (95% confidence)

// Automotive  
toyota: ['toyota', 'camry', 'corolla', 'rav4'] → Vehicles (95% confidence)
