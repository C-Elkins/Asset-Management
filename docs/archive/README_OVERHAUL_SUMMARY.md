# README Overhaul Summary
**Date**: October 6, 2025  
**Commit**: `4928c52`

## 🎯 Objective
Transform the README from a technical developer manual into a marketing-focused product page that:
- Positions Krubles as a **universal asset management platform** (not just IT)
- Uses working PNG branding images (SVG had rendering issues on GitHub)
- Emphasizes value propositions and benefits over technical implementation
- Remains informative while being more scannable and sales-oriented
