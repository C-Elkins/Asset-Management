# ðŸ”§ CORS Error - FIXED!

## Problem You Had

```
[Error] Preflight response is not successful. Status code: 403
[Error] Origin http://localhost:3005 is not allowed by Access-Control-Allow-Origin
```

## Root Cause

Your frontend is running on `http://localhost:3005`, but the backend's CORS configuration didn't include this URL, so Spring Security was blocking all requests with 403 Forbidden.

## What I Fixed

### File: `backend/src/main/resources/application-dev.yml`

Added this configuration:

```yaml
app:
  cors:
    allowed-origins: "http://localhost:3000,http://127.0.0.1:3000,http://localhost:3005,http://127.0.0.1:3005,http://localhost:5173,http://127.0.0.1:5173"

cors:
  allowed-origins: 
    - "http://localhost:3000"
    - "http://127.0.0.1:3000"
    - "http://localhost:3005"      # YOUR FRONTEND (ADDED)
    - "http://127.0.0.1:3005"      # YOUR FRONTEND (ADDED)
    - "http://localhost:5173"
    - "http://127.0.0.1:5173"
```

### Why Two CORS Configurations?

1. **`app.cors.allowed-origins`** - Used by SecurityConfig (Spring Security)
2. **`cors.allowed-origins`** - Used by WebConfig (Spring MVC)

Both needed to be updated!

## ðŸ”„ RESTART REQUIRED

**Critical**: You MUST restart the backend for this to work!

### Stop Backend:

Option 1: Press `Ctrl+C` in the backend terminal

Option 2: Run this command:
```bash
pkill -f "spring-boot:run"
```

### Start Backend:

```bash
cd /Users/chaseelkins/Documents/Asset\ Management\ System/it-asset-management/backend
./mvnw spring-boot:run
```

### Wait For:
```
Started AssetManagementApplication in X.XXX seconds
```

### Test:
1. Refresh your browser (http://localhost:3005)
2. Try to login
3. The "Backend offline" error should be GONE! âœ…

---

## Verification

After restart, open browser console (F12) and you should see:

âœ… **Before fix:**
```
[Error] Origin http://localhost:3005 is not allowed by Access-Control-Allow-Origin. Status code: 403
```

âœ… **After fix:**
```
(No CORS errors - requests succeed!)
```

---

## What This Fixes

- âœ… Login page "Backend offline" error
- âœ… All API calls from frontend to backend
- âœ… Health check endpoints
- âœ… Authentication requests
- âœ… All /api/v1/* endpoints

---

## If Still Not Working After Restart

1. **Clear browser cache**: Cmd+Shift+R (hard refresh)

2. **Verify backend is running**:
   ```bash
   lsof -i :8080
   ```

3. **Check backend logs**:
   ```bash
   tail -f backend/backend.log
   ```

4. **Check browser console** (F12):
   - Look for any remaining CORS errors
   - Check network tab for failed requests

5. **Verify frontend URL**:
   - Make sure you're accessing: http://localhost:3005
   - Not: http://127.0.0.1:3005 or other port

## Technical Details

### SecurityConfig.java (Line 133)

The SecurityConfig was looking for this property:
```java
@Value("${app.cors.allowed-origins:http://localhost:3005}")
```

But we only had `cors.allowed-origins` configured, not `app.cors.allowed-origins`.

Now both are configured correctly!

### CORS Preflight Requests

The 403 errors were happening during OPTIONS preflight requests that browsers send before the actual API calls. Spring Security was rejecting these because your frontend origin wasn't in the allowed list.

**Status**: READY TO TEST after backend restart! ðŸš€
